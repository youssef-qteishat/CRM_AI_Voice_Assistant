My bill is usually pretty consistent, but this time, there’s an extra fee labeled as 'Additional Services' that I don’t recognize. I didn’t sign up for anything new, and I want to make sure I’m not being charged for something by mistake. Can you help me understand what’s going on and how we can fix it? Oh, and by the way, I also noticed that my last payment hasn’t been reflected yet—it looks like there might be a delay or an issue processing it. Could we check on that as well? Thanks for your help!"}
